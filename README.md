#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools tot the development and maintainace of high quality software systems
software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by creating software systems that power vairious aspects of modern life like communication, commerce, entertainment and health care.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages 
the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology usees a sequential approach with distinct phases while agile methodology iterative and incremental approach focussed on flexibility and response to change.
Waterfall methodology for example is suitable in construction projects whereby sequencial steps are crucial so as to bring out efficiency.
Agile methodology is suitable in marketing campaigns where adapting to real time data and trends is neccesary 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer writes the code and impliments software solutions
A Quality Officer Engineer Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

These are Software engineering tools that enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some of the chalanges include:Changing requirenments, tight deadlines and technical debt
These challanges can be overcome by effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of task and regular reassessment of project goals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
they are important such that they help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possisble responces from AI modules. 
prompt engineering makes the questions clear and specific so that AI can understand exactly what you need.
